This repository contains the cache of the `node_modules` directory of the
[`cockpit`](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit) repository.

There is no linear history here.  The commits here are present only as tags,
pointing to single commits, generated by a workflow running `npm install` on
`package.json` from any pull request which changes it.

The tags are named `sha-REF` where `REF` is the 40-character hexadecimal
identifier of the commit that the tag points to.  A reference back to this
identifier is stored as a gitlink for the `node_modules` directory in the
`cockpit` repository, and landed alongside the `package.json` changes in the
pull request.

Additionally, each time cockpit is released, there will be an additional tag
which points to the `node_modules` which were used for that release.  This tag
will be the simple version number, equal to the version of the release.
